## Project setup
```
npm i
npm run serve
```

This project is completed. Auth and the required queries with Supabase are functional. To expand on this project, we could utilize an existing API (likely from Cagematch, if they allow access), to automate keeping up with records. But, as a portfolio piece and an introduction to Supabase, the repo serves its purpose.
